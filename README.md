# Fungeon_Scratch
All files are run through the AndroidLauncher (found in android src)
Scratches that work are:
-Arrow_Scratch
-BigAnimation_Scratch
-Box2D_Scratch
-Animation_Scratch (I used this to test animations individually, but BigAnimation_Scratch encompasses animation and tiled maps)

To run different files just change the file in the AndroidLauncher
sorry for it being so counter intuitive
