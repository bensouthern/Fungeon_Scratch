# Fungeon_Scratch
All files are run through the AndroidLauncher (found in android src)
Scratches that work are:

-Arrow_Scratch (clivk and drag touch pad back to shoot "arrows")

-BigAnimation_Scratch (left right, up Arrow Keys to move/ jump, and down arrow key to switch colur scheme)

-Box2D_Scratch (use touch pad to move box)

-Animation_Scratch (I used this to test animations individually, but BigAnimation_Scratch encompasses animation and tiled maps)

To run different files just change the file in the AndroidLauncher
sorry for it being so counter intuitive
